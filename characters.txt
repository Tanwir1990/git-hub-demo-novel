Jay Catsby - A definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase. Definite articles such as 
English the are used to refer to a particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker 
has already mentioned or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.

Nick Carraway - For example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus expresses a request for 
a particular book. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses an indefinite article and thus conveys that 
the speaker would be satisfied with any book.

Daisy Buchanan - Give me the book.
The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:
The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica genus.

Thomas "Tom" Buchanan - A recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to 
certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role 
in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.
